No waiting in long lines, no rushing between places, no worrying about souvenirs. Our layover specialists guide you through Seattle's highlights so you can enjoy food, views, and photos &mdash; and still return to the airport with time to spare.\n\nMost people say, \"I've been to Seattle, but only in the airport.\" With us, you'll leave saying, \"I really felt Seattle\" &mdash; with stories, photos, and memories worth sharing."

        question: "Who provides the transportation during the tour?",

These providers carry $1 million in liability coverage per ride, which protects all passengers in the event of an accident.\n\nWe handle all the logistics &mdash; meeting your driver, coordinating pickup/drop-off, and keeping the schedule on track &mdash; but we do not own or operate the vehicles. This means the rides are fully insured by Uber/Lyft, while we focus on ensuring your journey is smooth and stress-free."

        question: "What if I need to cancel?",
        answer: "• Free cancellation up to 24 hours before your tour.\n• Cancellations within 24 hours are non-refundable.\n• To cancel, email booking@sixhourlayover.com and our team will process it manually.\n• Note: \"Extra child\" and \"Family bundle\" pricing have been removed."
      },
      {
        question: "What if we have 4–5 adults?",
        answer: "Pricing is flat per person ($250, $300, $350 depending on tour length). There are no group discounts, as larger groups often require larger or multiple vehicles. This keeps pricing simple and fair."
