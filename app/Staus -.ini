Hi Manpreet,

Thanks for asking — here’s the updated structure reference for all our tour pages based on the final verified version (Oct 25, 2025).

Please follow this same layout for consistency:



1️⃣ Hero banner — page title, short subtitle, and “Book Tour” button.

 Example: “6-Hour Layover in Seattle – Pike Place & Waterfront Highlights.”

 Add a tagline like “Turn your layover into a mini adventure — out to the city, back on time.”

 Use a relevant background photo (Pike Place, skyline, etc.).



2️⃣ Intro paragraph — short summary (1 paragraph) with 1 image on the right.



3️⃣ Itinerary Overview — bullet points with short descriptions of destinations for each route:

 • 6-hour → Pike Place Market + Seattle Waterfront

 • 7-hour → Pike Place Market + Waterfront + Kerry Park (+ Molly Moon’s Ice Cream)

 • 8-hour → Pike Place Market + Space Needle



4️⃣ Timing & On-Time Guarantee — paragraph on the built-in 2-hour return buffer and live flight tracking.



5️⃣ Meeting Point — explain that the guide meets guests at their arrival gate or as close as possible inside SEA-Tac Airport.

 Include a relevant airport photo (e.g., guide holding tote bag or airport signage).



6️⃣ Pricing & Inclusions — use the latest verified prices:

 • 6-hour: $250 pp / $399 solo / $750 family

 • 7-hour: $300 pp / $450 solo / $900 family

 • 8-hour: $350 pp / $499 solo

 • Add-on: $120 per tour

 Add a call-to-action button: “Book Your Seattle Tour.”



7️⃣ Why Travelers Love It — bullet list (stress-free, family friendly, multilingual, great photos, etc.).



8️⃣ Final Call-to-Action — short text: “Make your layover unforgettable — book now or message us on WhatsApp.”

 Buttons: “Book Now” + “Chat on WhatsApp.”



For design style, please follow our current homepage look — clean white background, soft purple accents, one large image per section, and simple scrolling layout.





Let’s also include the following additional pages in the sitemap and website layout for SEO and user navigation:

• /faq – with 8–10 key traveler questions (I’ll send text separately).

• /contact – simple form (Name / Email / Message), plus booking@sixhourlayover.com, WhatsApp button, and SEA-Tac base address.

• /mandarin-seattle-layover and /japanese-seattle-layover – same structure as /seattle-layover-tour, just translated intros + CTA.



Please make sure each language page has proper hreflang tagging and all new pages appear in the sitemap.









I’ll attach the full content for each page (6-, 7-, 8-hour, and overview) so you can copy it directly into these sections.



Thanks again, Manpreet — this structure and layout should make everything consistent, SEO-friendly, and visually polished.
